            <h1>A NEW HOPE</h1>

            <p>It is a period of civil war.
                Rebel spaceships, striking
                from a hidden base, have won
                their first victory against
                the evil Galactic Empire.</p>

            <p>During the battle, Rebel
                spies managed to steal secret
                plans to the Empire's
                ultimate weapon, the DEATH
                STAR, an armored space
                station with enough power to
                destroy an entire planet.</p>

            <p>Pursued by the Empire's
                sinister agents, Princess
                Leia races home aboard her
                starship, custodian of the
                stolen plans that can save
                her people and restore
                freedom to the galaxy.....
